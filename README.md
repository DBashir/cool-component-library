# cool-component-library

This is a component library created using React & TS. It has been created as a means of learning both react & npm package creation.

You can add this package to your own react project with the following:
- npm install @DBashir/cool-component-library
- import components from the cool-component-library as you would with any library: 

```import { Component } from "@alexeagleson/template-react-component-library";```

- Use your component as normal <Component />
